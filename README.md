#Learning codes from Book *Professional-Javascript-for-Web-Developer*

I have tried to read through the whole book by writing the codes displayed in this book.

Along with the codes, I keep writing the learning dairy in Chinese.

The dairy could be found in [My Blog](http://www.cnblogs.com/JonathanC/).
